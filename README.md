# Blackjack-Game

Key Features in this Game Project

1. Multiplayer Support:
Players are asked to input their names and play individually against the dealer.

2. Scorekeeping and Multiple Rounds:
Each player starts with a score of 3. Scores are adjusted after each round:
Win: +1
Loss: -1
Push: No change

3. Elimination Mechanism:
If a playerâ€™s score reaches 0, they are eliminated from the game.
If all players are eliminated, the game ends.

4. Dealer Simulation:
The dealer plays according to standard rules, hitting until their hand reaches 17 or more.

5. Replay Support:
Players can choose to play another hand after each round or end the game.


This new implementation ensures that the game works even with multiple players. It handles scores and eliminates the players. We can play multiple rounds.
